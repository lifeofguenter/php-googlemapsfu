========================================================================
sad attempt to "reverse engineer" Google-Maps JS for PHP


## Description

This is a PHP Library to mimick the Google Maps Javascript API V3 so you will
have similar functionality in pure PHP. This will _not_ generate any Javascript
to echo/include/whatever into your HTML. 

It is very incomplete so feel free to contribute _and_ to optimize where needed.

## Usage

Please refer to the examples.
